# Streams over Nexus

> This package is experimental and may change in future versions.

A Nexus operation can return a stream instead of a single result. The
handler starts the operation, hands the caller a reference to a stream, and
the stream's producer keeps appending records to it. The caller Workflow
reads the records as they arrive. The operation completes when the stream
closes.

The records never pass through the caller's History. What reaches the
caller is progress: a small note that says the stream moved, with a position
and a counter. The caller then reads the records through the stream service
on the operation's endpoint.

## When to use it

Use a stream-returning operation when a caller in another namespace, or in
another team's service, needs a feed of results while the work runs. For
example a model's tokens, the steps of a long job, or messages for a chat
channel.

Inside one namespace you do not need Nexus. A Workflow or a client can read a
stream it knows the reference of directly, as in the
[package README](../README.md).

## Server setup

Streams over Nexus needs these dynamic config values on, for the namespaces
involved:

| Setting | Why |
|---|---|
| `history.enableChasm` | The stream notifier and the caller's operation run on CHASM. |
| `history.enableCHASMCallbacks` | The notifier delivers progress and the completion through CHASM callbacks. |
| `nexusoperation.enableChasmWorkflowOperations` and `nexusoperation.chasmWorkflowOperationsRolloutPercent: 100` | The caller's operation must use the CHASM path. Only that path accepts progress. |
| `nexusoperation.enableProgress` | The caller accepts progress deliveries. |
| `nexusoperation.callback.endpoint.template` | The callback URL the caller gives the handler. Point it at the frontend's HTTP address, for example `http://localhost:7243/namespaces/{{.NamespaceName}}/nexus/callback`. |
| `callback.allowedAddresses` | The notifier only calls addresses on this list. Add the frontend's HTTP address, for example `- Pattern: "localhost:7243"` with `AllowInsecure: true` when it serves plain HTTP. |
| `streamnotifier.enabled` | The server holds the callbacks of a stream and delivers its progress. |

Without progress, the operation still runs. The caller then gets the
completion only, and its reader sees every record at the end.

Turn on `nexusoperation.enableProgress` and `streamnotifier.enabled` only once
every server in the cluster runs a version that has them. Before a downgrade,
turn them off and let open stream notifiers finish, because an older server
cannot run the tasks they leave behind.

## The handler side

The handler names the stream and returns a `StreamOperationHandler`. Its
`open_stream` function usually starts the Workflow that produces the stream
and returns the stream's reference. The handler never appends; the producer
does.

```python
import nexusrpc
import nexusrpc.handler
import temporalio.nexus
from temporalio import workflow
from temporalio.common import WorkflowIDConflictPolicy
from temporalio.contrib.streams import StreamRef, topic, workflow_writer
from temporalio.contrib.streams.nexus import StreamOperationHandler, close_workflow_stream

MESSAGES = topic("messages", Message)

@nexusrpc.service
class ConversationService:
    respond: nexusrpc.Operation[str, str]

@workflow.defn
class Conversation:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, request: str) -> None:
        writer = workflow_writer(MESSAGES)
        for reply in make_replies(request):
            writer.publish(reply)
        close_workflow_stream("done", topic=MESSAGES)

async def open_conversation(ctx, request: str) -> StreamRef:
    workflow_id = f"conversation-{ctx.request_id}"
    await temporalio.nexus.client().start_workflow(
        Conversation.run, request, id=workflow_id,
        task_queue=temporalio.nexus.info().task_queue,
        id_conflict_policy=WorkflowIDConflictPolicy.USE_EXISTING,
    )
    return StreamRef.for_workflow(workflow_id, topic=MESSAGES.name)

@nexusrpc.handler.service_handler(service=ConversationService)
class ConversationHandler:
    @nexusrpc.handler.operation_handler
    def respond(self) -> nexusrpc.handler.OperationHandler[str, str]:
        return StreamOperationHandler(open_conversation)
```

`USE_EXISTING` lets a retried start find the Workflow the first attempt
started. The server keys a stream's notifier by the owner's run chain, which
it looks up from the owner Workflow, so the owner must exist when the start
returns and whenever the producer notifies. Starting it in `open_stream`, as
above, covers both.

The store rides the handler Worker's client, with notifications on. The
Worker serves the stream service next to the handler, so the caller reads on
the same endpoint:

```python
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.contrib.streams.redis import RedisStreams   # or MemoryStreams()
from temporalio.contrib.streams.nexus import TemporalStreamsHandler

store = RedisStreams("redis://localhost:6379").notify_on_append()
client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233", plugins=[store])
worker = Worker(
    client,
    task_queue="conversations",
    workflows=[Conversation],
    nexus_service_handlers=[ConversationHandler(), TemporalStreamsHandler()],
)
```

Core serves the stream service. `TemporalStreamsHandler` hands each call to
Core and keeps only what Core can't do: your `authorize` callable and the
namespace's payload codec. It holds nothing between calls, so it needs no
shutdown, and any Worker on the endpoint's task queue can serve a reader's
next read. The reader carries Core's read state in each read instead. So
the reader and the stream service come from the same release. A stream
service from an earlier release refuses the reader's `state` as an unknown
member.

`notify_on_append()` turns on progress only. Without it, the caller sees no
progress, but the close still completes every operation with its result.
Core closes a stream's notifier after every store close whenever the store
has a client, whether or not progress is on. Turn it on before the client
connects. One store instance serves one client connection, so a second
`Client.connect` with the same instance raises `ValueError`. A client
copied from the connected one with `Client(**config)` shares it. A server without the stream notifier costs one call, and then
Core stops notifier calls in that process.

Core notifies each stream's notifier after every append and every Workflow
batch that becomes visible. It keeps one notifier per stream, and drops it
when the stream closes, when the owner's run chain ends, or when it is the
least recently used of more than `notify_on_append(max_notifiers=...)`
(1000 by default). A notification goes out in the background, and a Worker
built from the client waits up to 10 seconds for the ones still out when it
stops. A process that holds only a client, such as an outside producer that
appends and then exits, calls `await store.flush_notifications()` before it
exits, so a caller doesn't wait for progress that was never sent.

Closing the stream completes every operation that handed it out:

- From the owning Workflow, `close_workflow_stream(result, topic=...)`. The
  close commits with the Workflow Task, like a publish. Once the Worker has
  made the task's records visible, it closes the stream in the store and
  then completes the operations, so a reader never misses a record
  published in the same task.
- From outside a Workflow, for example an Activity or the process that sees
  the work end, `await store.close_stream(client, ref, result)`. It closes
  the stream in the store first, so a later append from a client or an
  Activity raises `StreamClosedError`, and then closes its notifier. It
  raises when either refuses the close. The owner Workflow's own later
  publishes still land, since Workflow code can't be refused
  deterministically, and readers that already ended miss them. So close a
  Workflow-owned stream from the Workflow.

A reader ends when the stream service says the stream is done: the stream
is closed in the store and the reader has every record.

`result` becomes the operation's result, for example a summary. A cancel
from the caller detaches its callback and completes that caller's operation
as canceled. The stream keeps going for any other caller. A start without a
callback is refused.

`temporalio.workflow` also has generated low-level bindings for the
notifier: `notify_stream`, `attach_stream_callback` and
`detach_stream_callback`. Use `close_workflow_stream` rather than
`notify_stream`. Attach and detach have no use from Workflow code: the
handler attaches, and a cancel detaches.

What happens underneath:

1. The handler's start attaches the caller's callback to the stream's
   notifier on the server, and returns the stream reference in the
   operation token.
2. Core notifies the notifier after each append and each visible Workflow
   batch. Notifications are folded: at most one call is in flight, and the
   newest one wins.
3. The notifier delivers the latest notification to the caller as progress.
4. The close completes the caller's operation with the close result.

## The caller side

The caller Workflow starts the operation as usual and reads it with a
`StreamReader`:

```python
from temporalio.contrib.streams.nexus import StreamReader

handle = await nexus_client.start_operation(ConversationService.respond, request)
reader = StreamReader(handle, item_type=Message, endpoint=ENDPOINT)
while (batch := await reader.next()) is not None:
    for message in batch:
        ...
summary = await handle
```

A client generated from a service that declares the operation's stream
result has a `read_<op>_stream(handle)` method that builds the reader for
you, with the endpoint defaulting to the client's:

```python
reader = nexus_client.read_respond_stream(handle)
```

What `next()` does:

- It reads the records after its cursor through the stream service on
  `endpoint`, and returns their bodies decoded to `item_type`. The first
  call reads at once. Later calls read on while answers carry records, and
  wait for newer progress only after an answer with no record. It never
  returns an empty list.
- It returns `None` only when the stream service says the stream is done,
  and the last records are handed over. After the operation completes, the
  reader keeps reading until then, waiting up to 2 seconds per read. Every
  call after that returns `None` too.
- It hands over data records only. When a producer's earlier attempt was
  replaced by a newer one, the reader records that in
  `reader.supersessions`, in order, instead of returning it from `next()`.
  Each entry is a `ReadSupersession` with `index` (how many items had been
  handed over when it came), `cursor` and `supersession`. The stream service
  marks it. Each read carries the state the last answer gave, so the marks
  hold across reads, across the service's Workers, and for a reader built
  with `after=`:

  ```python
  if reader.supersessions:
      workflow.logger.warning("a producer restarted: %s", reader.supersessions[-1])
  ```

- A record that an earlier attempt of a producer wrote after a newer attempt
  started is not the current answer, so `next()` does not return it. The
  reader records it in `reader.stale_records`, in order. Each entry is a
  `ReadStaleRecord` with `index`, `cursor`, `producer_id`, `attempt` and the
  decoded `value`. This happens when an Activity attempt times out but keeps
  running.
- A record whose body does not decode into `item_type` raises
  `temporalio.contrib.streams.StreamRecordError` (a `StreamError` with
  `.cursor`), after the records before it are handed over. The next call
  goes on past it, so the Workflow can catch it and keep reading.
- A failed read raises `temporalio.exceptions.NexusOperationError`. So does
  a failed operation, after the records it left are handed over.
- If the operation's token names no stream, it raises `ValueError`.

Bodies reach the Workflow decoded. The stream service decodes them with its
Worker's data converter, the read result crosses once encoded with that
Worker's payload codec, and the caller's codec decodes it. So the handler's
Worker and the caller's Worker must use the same payload codec.

The codec runs in the handler Worker's process, as a step Core asks for in
the middle of a call. So Core holds plain bodies in memory during a call:
an append's bodies before the codec encodes them, and a read's bodies after
the codec decodes them. Core never stores or logs them, and sends them only
in the read's answer. The store keeps only encoded bodies.

Each read is a synchronous Nexus operation of the Workflow, so History
records it and a replay reads the same records. When a read finds no new
record, the reader waits on the operation's progress, which is also on the
handle:

```python
progress = await handle.progress()          # waits for the first progress
newer = await handle.progress(after_counter=progress.counter)
latest = handle.latest_progress             # or None
```

`progress()` returns `None` when the operation completes before newer
progress arrives. Progress comes from History, so a replay returns the same
values at the same points.

### History cost and long streams

Reading a stream adds to the caller's History in two ways.

- Each read is a synchronous Nexus operation, about three events, and its
  answer holds up to 1 MiB of records.
- Each progress delivery costs at most one Workflow Task, three events,
  and up to about 3 KiB on its scheduled event. The server schedules a task
  for progress no sooner than `nexusoperation.progressMinInterval` (1 second
  by default, per namespace) after the caller Workflow's last task that
  carried progress. Progress that comes sooner waits and folds. A task
  scheduled for any other reason still carries it, and 0 turns the interval
  off. The interval is per caller Workflow, so all its operations share it,
  and a busy caller costs about one progress task per second plus its
  reads.

The server terminates a Workflow whose History passes 51,200 events or
50 MiB by default. To read a long stream, Continue-as-New before that, for
example when `workflow.info().is_continue_as_new_suggested()` is true. Pass
`reader.cursor` to the new run, start the operation again there, and resume
after the cursor:

```python
reader = StreamReader(handle, item_type=Message, endpoint=ENDPOINT, after=cursor)
```

Two cases stop a reader that would otherwise read for ever.

- After the operation completes, the reader reads until the stream service
  says the stream is done. If its reads find nothing for `drain_limit`
  (60 seconds by default, a `StreamReader` keyword), it raises
  `temporalio.contrib.streams.nexus.StreamIncompleteError`, whose `.cursor`
  says where it stopped. That happens when the owner's close never reached
  the store, or when the Workflow id moved on to a new run chain whose
  topic is still open.
- A record too large for one read answer raises `StreamRecordError` at its
  cursor, and the next call goes on past it. The stream service refuses an
  append of such a record, so this only happens for a record written to the
  store directly.

## Limits and timeouts

- A notification's `position` is at most 1 KiB of UTF-8, and its metadata
  at most 2 KiB. The server refuses larger ones.
- A stream's notifier holds at most `streamnotifier.maxCallbacks` callers
  (100 by default). An attach beyond that is refused.
- A read answer holds at most 1 MiB of records
  (`TemporalStreamsHandler(..., max_answer_bytes=...)`). The reader goes on
  with the next read.
- If a stream gets no attach and no notification for
  `streamnotifier.idleTimeout` (7 days by default), the notifier fails the
  callers waiting on it. The stream stays open, and later attaches and
  notifications work as before.
- While callers are attached, the notifier checks the owner Workflow every
  `streamnotifier.ownerCheckInterval` (5 minutes by default). If the owner's
  run chain closed without closing the stream, the notifier closes it and
  fails the callers.
- A closed stream's notifier completes late attaches right away for
  `streamnotifier.closedRetention` (7 days by default, the store's
  retention), then refuses them. Keep it at least as long as the store
  keeps a stream's records.
- Once a Workflow id is reused by a new run chain, a late start for the
  earlier chain's stream (a stream reference that names one of its runs)
  fails: the server refuses its attach with `InvalidArgument` instead of
  completing it with that stream's close result. The server attaches only
  to the chain that holds the id now. A reference that names no run
  attaches to the new chain.
- If a caller answers a progress delivery with 404, its operation is
  already closed, and the notifier drops that caller. Any other refusal
  turns progress off for that caller, and it still gets the completion.
- A reader reads the run chain the owner's Workflow id has at each read,
  not the chain its operation started on. If the chain ends and the same id
  starts a new one while a reader still drains, the reader can hand over
  the new chain's records. Give each stream owner its own Workflow id, or
  reuse an id only after its readers finish.
- `close_workflow_stream` closes the stream after Core promotes the Workflow
  Task's records. The store closes first, then the notifier. A failed
  promotion and each failed close step are tried again with backoff, from
  1 second up to 1 minute, until they land or the Worker stops. A close the
  server refuses for good, such as one for a stream it doesn't know, isn't
  retried.
- What's left is a Worker that stops before it promotes the Workflow Task
  that closes the stream. A reader's repair then promotes the batch, but a
  repair sends no close. Readers still end once the owner's run chain
  closes, since the store marks the chain closed. The callers don't get the
  result, and fail at the notifier's next owner check
  (`streamnotifier.ownerCheckInterval`).
- When the owner's run chain ends, the Worker that ran the final task
  closes the notifier of every topic of the chain that's still open, so
  their callers' operations complete with an empty result. It does so after
  the final task's own closes, so a topic closed with
  `close_workflow_stream` keeps its own result. The server keeps the first
  close it gets, so a reader that finds the owner ended closes only the
  store. If the Worker that ran the final task stopped first, the callers
  fail at the notifier's next owner check instead. Topics written only by an
  SDK release from before the store moved into Core aren't listed, and fail
  the same way. So do all topics when the Redis user lacks `+sadd` and
  `+smembers`, which the ACL from before the move doesn't have. Widen it
  with the upgrade (see the Redis guarantees page).

## Guarantees

- **Highest counter wins.** Each progress has a counter. The caller keeps
  the highest one and drops any lower or repeated one, so deliveries may
  arrive out of order.
- **A burst folds.** Progress that arrives while the caller is between
  Workflow Tasks waits for the next task. The server also holds progress
  until `nexusoperation.progressMinInterval` (1 second by default) has
  passed since the caller Workflow's last task that carried progress. So a
  burst of any size costs the caller at most two tasks: the one it rides,
  and one follow-up when newer progress folded in after that task was
  already scheduled. The Workflow then sees the highest counter of the
  burst. Intermediate counters may be skipped, which is why the reader
  reads records and does not count progress.
- **No History event per delivery.** Progress rides the caller's next
  Workflow Task scheduled event. History is still the record, so replay
  sees the same progress.
- **Completion never waits for progress.** The operation completes when the
  stream closes, whether or not a progress delivery is in flight. Progress
  for a closed operation is dropped.
- **Progress before the start is dropped.** The reader reads from its
  cursor when the start arrives, so nothing is lost.
- **A completion names the operation even when it beats the start.** The
  handler gives the notifier its operation token and start time when it
  attaches, and the notifier sends them with every delivery. A stream that
  is already closed when the caller starts still hands over its reference.
- **Old receivers degrade.** A caller on a server without progress refuses
  it, and the notifier stops sending progress to that caller. The
  completion still arrives.

## Do not pass store claims across Nexus

The stream reference names a stream: its owner and its topic. It carries no
credential for the store. Do not put a Redis URL, a key prefix or any store
credential in the operation's input, result or token, and do not build a
caller that reads the handler's store directly. The caller reads through
the stream service on the handler's endpoint, so it needs no access to the
handler's store.

The stream service writes and reads with its Worker's client and store
credentials, whatever caller sent the call. So by default every caller that
can reach the endpoint can read and append to every stream of the handler's
namespace, as any producer. Limit who reaches the endpoint with its allowed
caller namespaces, and pass `authorize` to `TemporalStreamsHandler` to check
each call. It gets a `StreamAccess` (`operation`, `stream`, the Nexus
`context` with the caller's headers, and for an append `producer_id` and
`attempt`) and answers whether to serve it. A refused call fails as
unauthorized.

Parked reads hold Nexus task slots on the handler's Worker for up to a few
seconds each. With many readers, give that Worker more Nexus pollers
(`nexus_task_poller_behavior`), and serve appends and reads on separate
task queues or endpoints, so an append doesn't wait behind parked reads.

## Sample

[`tests/contrib/streams/samples/nexus_slack_router.py`](../../../../tests/contrib/streams/samples/nexus_slack_router.py)
runs a handler that streams a conversation's messages and a caller Workflow
that reads them and files each one under its channel. Its test,
`tests/contrib/streams/test_nexus_samples.py`, runs it on a server with the
settings above and skips on a server without the stream notifier.

## Live tests

The stock dev server has no stream notifier, so the sample test and the
reader, progress and stream operation lifecycle tests skip there.
`scripts/streams_live_lane.sh` builds a server that has the notifier, starts
it with the settings above and a scratch Redis, and runs those tests against
it, along with Core's live notifier test. It fails unless each test on its
gated list passes. A release of streams over Nexus needs a green run of it,
until CI has a lane with such a server.

"""Streams: an ordered log a Workflow owns, written from many places.

.. warning::
    This package is experimental and may change in future versions.

A Workflow owns a stream. Producers outside Workflow code, such as the
Workflow's Activities and clients, append to it, and outside readers consume
it from a cursor. Records live in a store the application runs, which
Core reaches for every SDK. Record bodies never reach the server.

The contract:

1. **A new attempt supersedes the old one.** When a reader sees the first
   record of a producer's newer attempt, it yields a
   :attr:`RecordKind.SUPERSEDED` record first. It withdraws only what that
   producer wrote in its earlier attempts, not the whole stream and not the
   records of other producers. No store holds that record, so every store
   reports a retry the same way.

The stored record is ``temporal.sdk.streams.v1.StreamRecord``, in
:mod:`temporalio.bridge.proto.streams.v1`, with the user's value in ``body``
as an ordinary payload.

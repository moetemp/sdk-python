"""Streams: an ordered log a Workflow owns, written from many places.

.. warning::
    This package is experimental and may change in future versions.

A Workflow owns a stream. Producers outside Workflow code, such as the
Workflow's Activities and clients, append to it, and outside readers consume
it from a cursor. Records live in a store the application runs, which
Core reaches for every SDK. Record bodies never reach the server.

The contract:

1. **Producers write with an identity.** A producer has an id, an attempt
   and a sequence that starts at one for each attempt. A retry of the
   newest batch with the same content is written once and returns the
   original position. A retry with different content, or with a lower
   sequence, is refused with :class:`StreamProducerError`. Content is
   compared over the payloads the converter produced, before the codec, so
   a codec with a fresh nonce per call still deduplicates a retry.
2. **A new attempt supersedes the old one.** When a reader sees the first
   record of a producer's newer attempt, it yields a
   :attr:`RecordKind.SUPERSEDED` record first. It withdraws only what that
   producer wrote in its earlier attempts, not the whole stream and not the
   records of other producers. No store holds that record, so every store
   reports a retry the same way. :class:`SupersessionTracker` names the
   records each one withdraws.
3. **A cursor belongs to one stream.** Hand it back to resume strictly after
   the record it names. A cursor from another store or another stream is
   refused with :class:`StreamCursorError`, and one whose record
   retention dropped with :class:`StreamExpiredError`. A read with no cursor
   starts at :data:`BEGINNING` or :data:`END`.
4. **Topics are defined once.** :func:`topic` defines a topic with the type
   its records decode to, and every party shares that definition. A call
   that names no topic addresses :data:`DEFAULT_TOPIC`.

A store is configured as a plugin:
``Client.connect(..., plugins=[RedisStreams(...)])`` registers it on the
client and on every Worker built from that client. Each
context then reaches a stream the same way:

- Workflow code publishes to its own stream with :func:`workflow_writer`.
  It buffers each value in the Workflow and sends the buffer through one
  Local Activity at a time per topic. :func:`workflow_activity_writer` runs
  a built-in Activity for each call instead.
- An Activity reaches the stream of the Workflow that scheduled it with
  :func:`activity_handle`, and writes as itself: its Activity id with the
  scheduling run id, and its Temporal attempt. A Local Activity writes as
  its call number in the run, with an attempt that grows across its reruns.
- Any process holding a client reaches a Workflow's stream with
  :func:`get_stream_handle`, and writes with a producer id and an attempt of
  its own.

Every read follows the Workflow's run chain across Continue-as-New and ends
when the chain closes. A reader can't pin one run.

In this release only a Workflow owns a stream, and only Activities and
clients read one. Reading inside a Workflow (:func:`workflow_reader`) and
the other owner kinds raise :class:`StreamUnsupportedError`.

The stored record is ``temporal.sdk.streams.v1.StreamRecord``, in
:mod:`temporalio.bridge.proto.streams.v1`, with the user's value in ``body``
as an ordinary payload.

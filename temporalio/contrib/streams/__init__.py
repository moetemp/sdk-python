"""Streams: an ordered log a Workflow owns, written from many places.

.. warning::
    This package is experimental and may change in future versions.

A Workflow owns a stream. Producers outside Workflow code, such as the
Workflow's Activities and clients, append to it, and outside readers consume
it from a cursor. Records live in a store the application runs, which
Core reaches for every SDK. Record bodies never reach the server. A Workflow
Task that publishes adds one marker event with a small manifest.

The contract:

1. **A new attempt supersedes the old one.** When a reader sees the first
   record of a producer's newer attempt, it yields a
   :attr:`RecordKind.SUPERSEDED` record first. No store holds that record,
   so every store reports a retry the same way.
2. **A cursor belongs to one stream.** Hand it back to resume strictly after
   the record it names. A cursor from another store or another stream is
   refused with :class:`StreamCursorError`, and one whose record
   retention dropped with :class:`StreamExpiredError`. A read with no cursor
   starts at :data:`BEGINNING` or :data:`END`.
3. **Topics are defined once.** :func:`topic` defines a topic with the type
   its records decode to, and every party shares that definition. A call
   that names no topic addresses :data:`DEFAULT_TOPIC`.

The stored record is ``temporal.sdk.streams.v1.StreamRecord``, in
:mod:`temporalio.bridge.proto.streams.v1`, with the user's value in ``body``
as an ordinary payload.

"""The errors a stream call raises.

Every stream condition is a :class:`StreamError`, so a caller can catch by
meaning the way it catches other :class:`temporalio.exceptions.TemporalError`
subclasses. Argument mistakes stay ``ValueError``.

Two distinctions matter to a caller that retries. A write the store refused
(:class:`StreamRefusedError`, which includes :class:`StreamProducerError`
and :class:`StreamClosedError`) did not happen, and repeating it gets the
same answer until something changes. A failure of the store or of the way
to it (:class:`StreamStorageError`) may hide a write that landed: for an
append that is :class:`StreamOutcomeUnknownError`, and repeating it on the
same producer is safe because the store deduplicates the retry. Errors from
the store's client library never escape: they arrive as one of these. A cursor
that names a record the store no longer keeps
(:class:`StreamExpiredError`) is told apart from one that is not valid for
the stream at all (:class:`StreamCursorError`). A stored record that the
reader can't decode (:class:`StreamRecordError`) carries its cursor, so the
caller can resume past it on purpose.

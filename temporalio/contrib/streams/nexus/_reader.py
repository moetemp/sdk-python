"""Read the stream a Nexus operation returns, from a Workflow.

A stream-returning operation stays open while its stream runs. Its handler
reports progress whenever the stream moves and completes the operation when
the stream closes; the operation token names the stream. The reader turns
that into batches of typed records: it reads from its cursor through the
stream service on a Nexus endpoint, and waits for progress once a read finds
nothing new.

Every read is a Nexus operation of the Workflow, so History records what each
read answered, and a replay hands over the same batches at the same points.

    Make one from the operation's handle and call :meth:`next` until it
    returns ``None``::

        reader = StreamReader(handle, item_type=Token, endpoint="chat")
        while (batch := await reader.next()) is not None:
            ...

    A generated client's ``read_<operation>_stream`` method builds one with
    the item type and endpoint the contract and the client know.

    The reader holds one cursor, starts at the oldest record the stream
    retains, and hands over each record once. Only data records are handed
    over; a producer's ``FINISH`` record is not. When a later attempt of a
    producer takes over (a retried Activity, for example), the earlier
    attempt's records already handed over stay handed over, and
    :attr:`supersessions` says where the later attempt began. A record whose
    body the Workflow's payload converter cannot decode into ``item_type``
    raises :class:`temporalio.contrib.streams.StreamRecordError` from
    :meth:`next` once the records
    before it are handed over; the call after that goes on past it.

    Each read goes to the run chain the Workflow id has when the read runs,
    not to the chain the operation token names: a stream reference pins a
    run, not a chain. So if the owner's chain ends and the same Workflow id
    starts a new chain while this reader still drains, a later read can hand
    over the new chain's records. Give each stream's owner a Workflow id of
    its own, or let the reader finish before the id is reused.

    Every read is a Nexus operation result in the caller's History, about
    three events and up to one read answer (1 MiB of records) each. To read a
    long stream, Continue-as-New before History grows too large: pass
    :attr:`cursor` to the new run, start the operation again there, and build
    the reader with ``after=cursor``. After a successful completion, the
    reader reads until the stream service says the stream is done, and raises
    :class:`StreamIncompleteError` once its reads have found nothing for
    ``drain_limit``. A read that fails because retention dropped the records
    after the cursor raises with ``StreamExpiredError`` as its cause. A new
    reader with no ``after`` starts again at the oldest record still kept.

    Bodies reach Workflow code decoded: the stream service decodes each body
    with its Worker's data converter, payload codec included, and the read's
    result travels back as one Nexus operation result, which this Worker's
    codec decodes. So the Workers on both sides need the same payload codec,
    as Workers in one namespace normally have.

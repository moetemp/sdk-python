"""The stream service: streams over a Nexus endpoint.

.. warning::
    This package is experimental and may change in future versions.

A process that cannot reach a stream's store, or should not, appends to and
reads from it through a Nexus endpoint. The endpoint runs the
``temporal.sdk.streams.v1.TemporalStreams`` service over the store the
endpoint's Worker carries, so callers never learn which store that is.

The service is defined once, in ``temporal_streams.nexusrpc.yaml`` next to
this file, and everything in :mod:`temporalio.contrib.streams.nexus._generated`
is generated from it by ``scripts/gen_nexus_streams_api.py``:

* :class:`TemporalStreams`, the service definition a handler implements and a
  Workflow's Nexus client calls.
* The models its operations take and return. :class:`StreamRef` is
  :class:`temporalio.contrib.streams.StreamRef` itself, so a reference a
  Workflow hands out is the value the service takes.
* :class:`TemporalStreamsHttpClient`, a caller for a process outside any
  Worker, posting to the endpoint over the Nexus HTTP ingress. It depends on
  nothing beyond the standard library.

:class:`TemporalStreamsHandler` serves the generated service over Core's
stream service, on the store of its Worker's client.

A Nexus operation can also hand its caller a stream.
:class:`StreamOperationHandler` is such an operation: its start attaches the
caller to the stream's notifier on the server and puts the
:class:`StreamRef` in the operation token (:func:`stream_ref_from_token`).
With :meth:`temporalio.contrib.streams.StreamStorePlugin.notify_on_append`
on, Core tells the notifier when the stream moves, which the caller sees as
operation progress.
:meth:`temporalio.contrib.streams.StreamStorePlugin.close_stream` completes
the operation, or :func:`close_workflow_stream` from the owning Workflow.

A caller Workflow reads such a stream with :class:`StreamReader`: it waits on
the operation's progress and reads through this service as Nexus operations
of the Workflow, so a replay hands over the same batches.

"""Reaching a stream from an Activity or from client code.

Every call goes to Core's stream service, which checks the owner, mints and
checks cursors, and synthesizes ``SUPERSEDED``. What stays here is what
needs the plaintext or the user's types: converting values, the two hashes
taken before the codec, and the codec itself.

An Activity reaches the stream of the Workflow that scheduled it, and writes
as itself: Core derives its producer id as
``<Activity id>@<scheduling run id>`` and its Temporal attempt is the
producer attempt, so a retry is reported to readers as ``SUPERSEDED``. The
run is part of the id because a stream outlives a run, and Activity ids
repeat across the runs of a chain.

Any process holding a client reaches a Workflow's stream by Workflow id and
writes with a producer id and attempt of its own.
